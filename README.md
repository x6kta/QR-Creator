# QR Creator

## Getting Started
Firstable, you'll need to install the interprter of my program, Python, just in case you don't have it.

> :information_source: Most of Linux distributions have already installed Python, if you're not sure though, I would recommend you to check if you already have it installed.

`Note: This script only works in any Linux based system. Windows isn't supported yet.`

### Prerequisites

The recommended version to run the script is:
* Python 3.10.6

You need to installl the following packages to run this script:
* `humanize`
* `qrcode`

To install the dependencies you only will have to use `pip3` and type these commands in your terminal:

```sh
pip install humanize
pip install qrcode
```

### Installation

1. Create a directory to import the whole project like this:

    ```sh
    mkdir "your own directory"
    cd "your own directory"
    ```
3. Clone the project:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/edugaray2022/QR-Creator.git
    ```
    

## Reasons why I made this
This script was made because of:
* I wanted to make a QR Code generator and use it in my terminal when I need to pass my wallet addresses either my Notion workspace.
* I wanted to learn about the Pyhton's modules `qrcode` and `hashlib`.
